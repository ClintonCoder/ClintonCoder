# My Portfolio

Welcome to my Github portfolio! I am a 2nd Year Computer Science student with a focus on cyber security and a passion for web development, programming, and penetration testing. Currently studying at the University of Huddersfield, I have a pragmatic background in both front-end and back-end programming, with experience in languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java. My keen interest in cyber security has led me to explore areas such as network security, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing, which has given me a solid understanding of how to identify and mitigate cyber threats. With my diverse skillset and thirst for knowledge, I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise.

## Projects

# Project 1: Webtools

Webtools is a platform for developers to easily access and integrate JavaScript and CSS scripts into their web projects without writing code from scratch. The platform offers a comprehensive library of scripts and a page for browsing and selecting preferred code. Webtools is constantly expanding its library and is accessible at https://webtoolsv1.000webhostapp.com/.

### A Team Project 2: CodeConnect

Description: Built on the foundations of WebTools, CodeConnect is a web development platform that facilitates collaboration and sharing of projects. It offers a range of features such as clustering, monetisation, and analytics to help developers connect, collaborate, and create projects efficiently. The platform provides different access levels and customisation options, making it suitable for developers of all levels. With its core values of teamwork, creativity, and community, CodeConnect is the perfect platform for developers looking to share and collaborate on web development projects. Due to funding, the domain is a work in progress.
